# Assessment Builder Platform

A comprehensive web platform for building and delivering modular assessments. Admins create assessments using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with multiple block types. End users receive unique links to complete assessments, and admins can review submissions, grade responses, and export data. The platform includes API endpoints compatible with n8n for automated AI evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Docker Desktop installed and running (for local database)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AssessmentBuilder
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp env.example .env
```
The default `.env` is configured for Docker. Edit if using a different database.

4. **Start PostgreSQL database with Docker:**
```bash
npm run db:up
```
This starts a PostgreSQL container on port 5433.

5. **Run database migrations:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```
This creates all required tables in your database.

6. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured PORT).

### Database Management Commands

- `npm run db:up` - Start the database container
- `npm run db:down` - Stop the database container
- `npm run db:logs` - View database logs
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database (removes all data)
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
- `npm run db:clear` - Clear all data (keeps tables)

### Using a Different Database

To use Neon, Supabase, or another PostgreSQL provider:

1. Update `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file
2. Skip the `npm run db:up` step
3. Run `npm run db:push` to create tables

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database won't start
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check if port 5433 is already in use: `lsof -i :5433`
- View logs: `npm run db:logs`

### Connection errors
- Wait a few seconds after starting the database
- Verify the container is healthy: `docker ps`
- Check the `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`

### Port conflicts
- Use `npm run kill-port` to free up port 5000
- Or update `PORT` in your `.env` file

### Reset everything
```bash
npm run db:reset
npm run db:push
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### API Key Encryption
- LLM API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key should be stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager (production)
- Keys are never returned in API responses

### User Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- Multi-tenant isolation via client IDs

### Proctoring & Anti-Cheating
- Video proctoring with MediaPipe Face Mesh
- Eye and face tracking with real-time violation detection
- Full-screen mode enforcement with exit detection
- Single-screen requirement (blocks multiple monitors)
- Browser compatibility check (Chrome-based/Edge only)
- Tab/window switching detection
- Copy/paste prevention (configurable per block)
- All violations logged with timestamps and screenshots (max 6 screenshots per assessment)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Google Cloud Platform (Recommended)
The platform is designed for deployment on Google Cloud:

- **Cloud Run**: Containerized deployment
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL
- **Secret Manager**: Secure storage for encryption keys
- **Cloud Storage**: Media file storage (abstraction layer ready, see `STORAGE_SETUP.md`)

### Environment Setup
1. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in Secret Manager
2. Configure `DATABASE_URL` for Cloud SQL
3. Set up Cloud Storage buckets (if using GCS storage - see `STORAGE_SETUP.md`)
4. Configure CORS origins for production domain
5. Set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=gcs` and provide GCS credentials if using Cloud Storage

### Docker Support
The platform can be containerized for deployment:
```bash
npm run build
# Use the built files in dist/ for containerization
```
